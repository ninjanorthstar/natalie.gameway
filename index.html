  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I am currently learning front end web development.  I felt it important to learn this skill set so that I could progress in my HTML skills and become a more valuable player in my current job.  I am employed as an office manager for a web development company and would love to take advantage of the opportunities for growth.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p class="p-about">I was born and raised in San Diego.  I have three brothers and one sister who are the most important people in my world.  Fortunately, we all live in the San Diego area so I get to spend plenty of time with them.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are my hobbies?</h2>
  <p class="p-about">I love to ride my motorcycle on quiet Sundays.  I'm still a fairly inexperienced rider, so I always plan a careful route.  I still have to make sure I am really familiar with the roads and that the weather is in my favor.</p>
  <h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
  <p class="p-about">I would love to be able to work from home in website design.  I am hoping that if I develop a good skill set, I can eventually see many parts of the world while working in different locations as long as I have access to the internet.  I'm hoping to spend a few years traveling the world while I work to support myself.</p>
